# Telegram-Bot

## Overview 

This repository consists of 1 .py file for the telegram bot. 

## Purpose

This is a code for a telegram bot I worked on in 2023 July. I wanted to make a telegram bot that translate messages sent in telegram using deepL. DeepL is a tool that provide far more accurate translations than google translate. By acquiring its API, we can use 500,000 characters / month for free. 

Due to my language proficiency, I only included English, Japanese, Spanish, and Chinese in this telegram bot. 

## Usage 

The API for deepL and telegram are included in the .py file because they are free. If anyone wants to recreate this, it is recommended to aquire APIs on their own. 

I aquired @lebab_bot for myself, but this bot is currently not working. It is because I was not able to find a server that runs this code 24/7 for free.
